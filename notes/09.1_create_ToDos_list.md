## What we will do:
- Create TodoController and list-todos.jsp
- Make TodoService a @Service and inject i


- First real application 
- Add, delete, modify toDo list 
- in memory kind of database -> List 
- Todo Service to add, delete and modify ToDo

Added src/main/java/com/ib/csg/cascade/model/ToDo.java in model since this will be used to put data in view. 
just define variables here and rest of code can be autogenerated.

Then we have added toDo Service
src/main/java/com/ib/csg/cascade/service/TodoService.java
this will add new list, retrive list, delete lit etc. 

Now we want to display todo link on welcome page. added following snippet in welcome.jsp and tested it: 
<h1> My First JSP!! Welcome ${name}. <a href="/list-todos" >Click here to manage your todos<\h1> 

it works till here. URL display error since we haven't configured it yet in contoller. 

Next we have added new TodoController and mapped it to /list-todos and created list-todos.jsp to display sample message.

## What we will do:
- Create TodoController and list-todos.jsp
- Make TodoService a @Service and inject i


- First real application 
- Add, delete, modify toDo list 
- in memory kind of database -> List 
- Todo Service to add, delete and modify ToDo

- Added src/main/java/com/ib/csg/cascade/model/ToDo.java in model since this will be used to put data in view.  

- Then we have added toDo Service : src/main/java/com/ib/csg/cascade/service/TodoService.java 
- this will add new list, retrive list, delete lit etc.

- Now we want to display todo link on welcome page. added following snippet in welcome.jsp and tested it: 
```
<h1> My First JSP!! Welcome ${name}. <a href="/list-todos" >Click here to manage your todos<\h1> 
```

it works till here. URL display error since we haven't configured it yet in the controller.

Next we have added new TodoController and mapped it to /list-todos and created list-todos.jsp to display sample message. Now retriving list of todos
for hardcoded user "nitin"

```
public String showtodoList(ModelMap model) {
 

        model.put("todos", service.retrivetoDos("nitin"));

        return "list-todos";


    }
```

So Now when we click on link to manage todo's we get following output:  
```
Welcome Nitin
This is displaying list of ToDos for nitin : [Todo [id=1, user=nitin, desc=Learn Java, targetDate=Sun Feb 14 11:56:57 EST 2021, isDone=false]]
```

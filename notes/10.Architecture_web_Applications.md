Typically any web applciation will have folowing 4 layers:
**- Web Layer**
once we have niz logic we can expose web services or as web application on screen. So it exposes biz logic to outside world. 
V(View) and C(controller) of MVC is in WEb Layer. 

 Servlet/JSP very basic way of developing web applications but no more used today. 
 Common MVC framework - Struts, Spring MVC
 Common View: Velocity, JSF, Angular, JSP, 
  
**- Business Layer** 
All business logic here, talk to integration layer, data layer etc. 

**- Data Layer**
To talk to database
M(Model) of MVC 


**- Integration Layer**
to talk to anothet application. So it helps ntegrate with other systems


Model2 Architecture: 
FRom Browser rquest is coming to Front Controler. In Spring MVC this Front Controller is called dispather servlet
DispatcherServlet will do mapping. /login is mapped to LoginController#sayHello method. 
Once it get mapped, it will return response which is "Hello World"
Once dispatcherServlet gets response "Hello World" it starts looking for view. to prevent it from looking for view and rather just ask dispatcherServlet to return whatever we are passing, we have used another annotation which is @ResponseBody 
This will return whatever method is returning directly to browser. Later we will see how to redirect it to JSP or another view resolver. 

Thus we have single point of conrol

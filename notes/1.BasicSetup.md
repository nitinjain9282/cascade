1- Do Basic setup as per details in ReadMe file info. 

3 most important files for Maven project are : 

**pom.xml**
- <parent> ==> 
   <parent> is very similar to inheritance in java. We are inheriting version from here for all our dependencies. 
   we are using spring-boot-starter-parent, so we want to inherit this pom for some of our dependencies. 
our parent is located at C:\Users\NITINJAIN\.m2\repository\org\springframework\boot\spring-boot-starter-parent\2.3.4.RELEASE\spring-boot-starter-parent-2.3.4.RELEASE.pom

- groupId, artifactId for project and version - SNAPSHOT version since project is in development. Also, packaging is defined here. we are using "jar" packaging for web application here since spring boot is embedded web application.

- dependencies are defined for libraries , important one here are  
   spring-boot-starter-web: this is required for any springboot web or restful application
   spring-boot-devtools:it brings in features to help with development of applciation productive. 
   spring-boot-starter-test: for writing Junit test
Maven will automatically download these dependencies as well as transitive dependencies and make them available as classpath in our project.    

- properties are defined to manipulate any runtime or buildtime versions. 
- last is spring-boot-maven-plugin under build section, this helps for easy run of web application and creating jar/war files etc. 

**src/main/java/com/ib/csg/cascade/CascadeApplication.java**
- @SpringBootApplication: it does two things, (a) it initializes Spring Framework. 
  SpringBoot is sitting on top of Spring so first thing it does is it initializes Spring Framework which means it initializes something called _Component Scan_. 
  (b) it initializes SpringBoot itself which means it initializes _Auto Configuration_. 
  
-  SpringApplication.run
   its basially running the class - CascadeApplication.class

**src/main/resources/application.properties**
- this can be used as configuration file, like changing port number etc. 

Note: 
to run project automatically in IntellJ, change following:
File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Compiler ==> Build project Automatically.

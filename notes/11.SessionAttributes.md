## What You Will Learn during this Step:
- Session vs Model vs Request.
- Be cautious about what you use Session for.
- @SessionAttributes("name") and how it works?

- Why use Model? "adding elements directly to the HttpServletRequest (as request attributes) would seem to serve the same purpose. The reason to do
  this is obvious when taking a look at one of the requirements we have set for the MVC framework: It should be as view-agnostic as possible, which
  means we’d like to be able to incorporate view technologies not bound to the HttpServletRequest as well." - Rod Johnson et. al’s book Professional
  Java Development with the Spring Framework

- Spring documentation states that the @SessionAttributes annotation “list the names of model attributes which should be transparently stored in the
  session or some conversational storage.”

```
@SessionAttributes("name")
We have added this to TodoController to store the SesionAttribute 
and  any other Controller -> LoginController where we want to retrive that Session Attribute.

```

- next use model to get this value and pass it to retrivetoDos method. 
  
- HTTP is basically stateless protocol so whatever state we are trying to store should be done on server side itself. 

Once we run applicatoon and enter login and password, we will dynamically get list of todos for given name: 

```
Output:
Welcome nitin
This is displaying list of ToDos for nitin : [Todo [id=1, user=nitin, desc=Learn Java, targetDate=Sun Feb 14 12:40:04 EST 2021, isDone=false]]
Welcome nitin ! How are you doing?
```

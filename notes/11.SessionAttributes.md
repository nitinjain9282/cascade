## What You Will Learn during this Step:
- Session vs Model vs Request.
- Be cautious about what you use Session for.
- @SessionAttributes("name") and how it works?
- Why use Model? "adding elements directly to the HttpServletRequest (as request attributes) would seem to serve the same purpose. The reason to do this is obvious when taking a look at one of the requirements we have set for the MVC framework: It should be as view-agnostic as possible, which means we’d like to be able to incorporate view technologies not bound to the HttpServletRequest as well." - Rod Johnson et. al’s book Professional Java Development with the Spring Framework
- Spring documentation states that the @SessionAttributes annotation “list the names of model attributes which should be transparently stored in the session or some conversational storage.”


- This can be easily acheived by adding @SessionAttributes("name") to both Logincomtroller and TodoController. 
- next use model to get this value and pass it to retrivetoDos method.  

- HTTP is basically stateless protocol so whatever state we are trying to store should be done on server side itself.

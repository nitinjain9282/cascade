## What You Will Learn during this Step:

- Your First JSP
- There is a bit of setup before we get there!
- Introduction to View Resolve

- we want to use view with html content
- for this we can use JSP or angular or whatever we feel comfortable with. 
- we need to create login.jsp ,**default path will be - src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/**

- Next we need to tell our controller to look for JSP so **we removed @ResponseBody Component,** this will now look for login page. 
- Whenever we provide view to dispatcher servlet it uses view resolver to resolve it. 
  But we need to tell controller where login.jsp is located, we can do this via application.properties file

- added following to application.properties

```  
spring.mvc.view.prefix = /WEB-INF/jsp/ 
spring.mvc.view.suffix = .jsp`
```
- Also, we need to include two more dependency in pom.xml to make it work 
```xml
<dependencies>
<dependency>
		<groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
		<artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
		<scope>compile</scope>	
</dependency>
<dependency>
		  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
		  <artifactId>jstl</artifactId>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
- Note: it will not work if we don't change scope from "provided" to "compile", After making changes, Right click pom.xml ==> Reload the provided
  scope may cause issues in production tomcat environments as tomcat provides those libraries already. 
- I fixed this using a profile embedded-tomcat with the custom property tomcat-embed-jasper.scope and setting it as runtime. by default this is
  provided when not running embedded mode. i.e. 
```xml
<dependency>
            <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
            <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
            <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
       

```
If you are using intellij change scope of tomcat-embed-jasper dependency from <scope>provided</scope> to <scope>compile</scope>
